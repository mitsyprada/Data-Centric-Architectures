In this module students are trained in architectural design at two conceptual levels: <br/>

At the level of System Architectures for “big data” applications they learn about top-level trade-offs, e.g., between measured data rates and required processing power. They get introduced to high-performance computing and streaming database technology.<br/>
At the level of Digital Signal Processing Architectures, they learn key concepts (fixed point, floating point) and technologies (FPGA, GPU, Mixed signal chips). Linear and Functional programming as well as Parallel processing are covered.
