At every pixel of the image, we need to combine the foreground image color (F) and the background image color (B) using the alpha mask (\\alpha).\n",

    "Screen mode inverts the values of each of the visible pixels in the two layers of the image. (That is, it subtracts each of them from 255.) Then it multiplies them together, divides by 255 and inverts this value again. The resulting image is usually brighter, and sometimes “washed out” in appearance. The exceptions to this are a black layer, which does not change the other layer, and a white layer, which results in a white image. Darker colors in the image appear to be more transparent.\n",

    "YOUR_STRING = 'The designers of some computer languages choose to emphasize one particular approach to programming. This often makes it difficult to write programs that use a different approach. Other languages are multi-paradigm languages that support several different approaches. Lisp, C++, and Python are multi-paradigm; you can write programs or libraries that are largely procedural, object-oriented, or functional in all of these languages. In a large program, different sections might be written using different approaches; the GUI might be object-oriented while the processing logic is procedural or functional, for example. In a functional program, input flows through a set of functions. Each function operates on its input and produces some output. Functional style discourages functions with side effects that modify internal state or make other changes that aren’t visible in the function’s return value. Functions that have no side effects at all are called purely functional. Avoiding side effects means not using data structures that get updated as a program runs; every function’s output must only depend on its input. Some languages are very strict about purity and don’t even have assignment statements such as a=3 or c = a + b, but it’s difficult to avoid all side effects. Printing to the screen or writing to a disk file are side effects, for example. For example, in Python a print statement or a time.sleep(1) both return no useful value; they’re only called for their side effects of sending some text to the screen or pausing execution for a second. Python programs written in functional style usually won’t go to the extreme of avoiding all I/O or all assignments; instead, they’ll provide a functional-appearing interface but will use non-functional features internally. For example, the implementation of a function will still use assignments to local variables, but won’t modify global variables or have other side effects. Functional programming can be considered the opposite of object-oriented programming. Objects are little capsules containing some internal state along with a collection of method calls that let you modify this state, and programs consist of making the right set of state changes. Functional programming wants to avoid state changes as much as possible and works with data flowing between functions. In Python you might combine the two approaches by writing functions that take and return instances representing objects in your application (e-mail messages, transactions, etc.).'\n",

    "*Multi threading improves performance by allowing multiple CPUs to work on a problem at the same time; but it only helps if two things are true: as long as the CPU speed is the limiting factor (as opposed to memory, disk, or network bandwidth) and so long as multithreading doesn’t introduce so much additional work (aka “overhead”) that the benefit is lost.*\n",

    "*Too much multithreading is just as much a problem as too little. Consider the task of assembling a house: it’s a big job, and having more than one worker is helpful. But there are limits. Ten workers is great! A hundred is challenging. Ten thousand probably means the house will get built more slowly than with just twenty (do you have enough tools? Enough bathrooms? Is there even enough work to do?). And there are also jobs that cannot be split; such as the old joke of hiring 9 women in order to gestate a baby in only one month instead of nine.*"
